# Next Session Handoff

Date: 2026-06-01

## Mainline Goal

Build a Mac-first learning companion for browser-based study. The core loop is:

- Read or watch in a browser while a calm sidecar stays nearby.
- Capture quotes, thoughts, timestamps, questions, and follow-up cards without breaking focus.
- Turn open questions into answers, cards, synthesis, review material, or parked follow-up.
- Mirror useful study state across Mac, Harmony phone, Windows, and Feishu-backed folders without pretending unverified integrations are done.

The product bias is a study cockpit, not a generic note app. Every feature should help the user decide what to inspect, capture, close, or review next.

## Current Branch State

Branch: `product/mvp-learning-sidecar`

Recent local work on top of `origin/product/mvp-learning-sidecar`:

- `4a257ca feat: make focus question signal actionable`
- `7a2c0d6 test: harden focus question signal`
- `3717aa4 test: verify focus question browser path`
- `1badbf9 feat: add morning inspection path`
- `24caecf feat: seed answers from open questions`
- `1760d58 feat: link mirror questions to inbox answers`
- `de3d3cd test: harden mirror answer prefill`

Current uncommitted work adds a parked-question queue after Mira review:

- `questionParkedAt` is an unresolved-but-not-active state, distinct from `questionResolvedAt`.
- Today Open Questions can `Park`; Today Parked Questions can `Answer`, `Resume`, or `Resolve`.
- Parked questions are excluded from Focus Brief and synthesis active open-question counts, but remain visible in Today / `TODAY.md`.
- Harmony reader view gets additive `parkedQuestions`, `parkedQuestionCount`, `unresolvedQuestionCount`, `isParkedQuestion`, and `questionParkedAt`.
- Model normalization clears illegal `resolved + parked` combinations.

## Verified Locally

These passed after the current parked-question work:

- `npm run smoke`
- `npm run smoke:harmony`
- `npm run smoke:browser`
- `npm run check:morning`
- `git diff --check`

Approval-gated or environment-gated checks were intentionally skipped tonight:

- Mac native build or manual app QA.
- DevEco/Harmony compile and device validation.
- Real Feishu write/sync verification.
- Push or GitHub remote operations if network/approval is unavailable.

## Mira Review Stance

Mira is now available as a Tony-only external review gate through the Hermes broker path. Use it for important artifacts, especially architecture, permission boundaries, data contracts, and risky UX claims.

Operational stance:

- Ask Mira for targeted criticism, blockers, evidence gaps, and concrete fixes.
- Accept only findings that can be tied to code, tests, docs, or risk posture.
- Do not blindly follow Mira. Reject generic advice that conflicts with tonight's no-approval constraint or the actual code evidence.
- Never send secrets, raw auth material, unsanitized logs, customer data, or high-risk personal data.

Latest absorbed Mira notes for mirror question answer links:

- Keep the link framed as a draft, not as completed answering.
- Treat every `inbox.html` query param as untrusted.
- Validate `topicId` against known topics and surface fallback.
- Add hostile escaping and round-trip tests beyond only `sourceUrl`.
- Document CSP and query-prefill boundaries.

Latest absorbed Mira notes for parked question loop:

- Normalize illegal `resolved + parked` state to resolved-only.
- Add Harmony unresolved-question count so active-only open questions do not hide parked unresolved questions.
- Let parked questions show when they were parked and provide a direct Answer path.
- Pin transition coverage for Park, Answer-from-parked, Resolve, Reopen, and Resume.

## Next Local Work

1. Commit the current parked-question queue once status is clean enough:
   - Suggested message: `feat: add parked question queue`.

2. Continue the study loop:
   - Add a small receipt or inspection cue showing whether newly drafted answers are ready for Mac-side import.
   - Consider a "question inbox health" cue: active, parked, answered, and due-review conversion.

3. Keep the cross-end story honest:
   - Mac/web offline path is strongest today.
   - Harmony remains schema/scaffold plus fixture evidence until compile/device gates run.
   - Feishu mirror is a dry-run/contract path until real write sync is verified.

4. Record approval-gated TODOs instead of stalling:
   - Mac build/manual QA.
   - Harmony device compile.
   - Feishu authenticated write test.
   - Push/GitHub actions if network is unavailable.

## Resume Commands

Start with:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -8
```

If continuing local validation:

```bash
npm run smoke
npm run smoke:browser
npm run check:morning
git diff --check
```

If preparing another review packet, use Mira for sharp critique and then decide what to absorb yourself.
